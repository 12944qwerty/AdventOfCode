# Advent of Code

Although I have done 2019-2022, I only started to save the code in 2022. I might go back and re-do the code later on, but unsure.

## Visualizations
 - Visualizations have been tested on a 1920 x 1080 fullscreen windows cmd terminal. It might not work very well on other sizes.
 - They have also been made mostly for dummy data as the real data takes far too long

# Rust
I decided to start learning rust to this and omg. It's so complicated. But we'll see how it goes.
I couldn't make a central file like I did with python yet, so you have to specify the bin.
